              <p> Before Donyale Luna became Donyale Luna, she was born Peggy Ann Freeman in Detroit, Michigan. The exotic mix of Mexican Indian, Afro-Egyptian bred a golden-brown skinned, endlessly tall, x-ray skinny girl whose face was adorned with thick lips; wide, al- mond-shaped eyes; a lean, thick nose; and wispy brows. Calling Luna a “woman” simply wouldn’t suffice. The mystical creature not only looked otherworldly, but was remembered by her sister as being “a very weird child, even from birth, living in a wonderland, a dream.”
              </p>

              <p> Fashion photographer David McCabe recalls seeing Luna walking down a street in Detroit in her kilt school uniform and being “stunned” by her stilt-like legs and facial bone structure. Luna was only eighteen at the time, and McCabe immediately offered her a trip to New York with the promise of a modeling contract.
              </p>

              <p> New York City’s reaction towards Luna was no different than that of McCabe. In a letter she wrote to her best friend, Luna recalls her arrival as “a dream... a man danced me down Fifth Avenue, and all up and down Broadway men were eyeing and whistling at me, and so many other unbelievable things.”
              </p>

              <p> Luna first appeared in print when Harper’s Bazaar published a sketch of her on a 1965 cover. One year later, Luna was photographed for a British Vogue cover, making her the first-ever black model on the cover of Vogue. Beatrix Miller, then editor in chief, chose Luna to be the magazine’s frontispiece because of her “bite and personality.”
              </p>

              <p> After the warm welcome she received upon moving to New York, Luna found her niche in the frenzy of the fashion, music and art scene. Soon, she was partying with people like Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones. With this lifestyle came the constant use of drugs and alcohol, which Luna became very fond of.

                  <br> </br>

              <p> The use of mind-altering drugs like LSD and hallucinogens fueled Luna’s natural tendency to make up stories and to live in fantastical ways. In response to her experience with LSD, Luna shared, “I think it’s great. I learned that I like to live, I like to make love, I really do love somebody, I love flowers, I love the sky, I like bright colors, I like ani- mals. (LSD) also showed me unhappy things — that I was stubborn, selfish, unreasonable, mean, that I hurt other people.
              </p>

              <p>  She had no interest in reality or responsibility, which made her difficult to work with. Photographers soon started to criticize her work ethic, saying that she often missed or showed up late to photoshoots and meetings. In a New York Times interview, her peer Beverly Johnson lamented, “She didn’t show up for bookings. She didn’t have a hard time, she made it hard for herself.”
              </p>

              <p> Along with her shaky work reputation, Luna also endured many failed relationships. She married and remarried often. In 1969, she was involved with German actor Klaus Kinski. Eventually Kinski made Luna leave his house as he was concerned her drug abuse would affect his career. The fantasy world that Luna had created for herself was initially captivating to Kinski and many others. But with time, these individuals craved a return to reality.
              </p>

              <p> When asked about her ethnicity, Luna would often claim to be from the moon. Regarding her influence on The Civil Rights movement, she commented that “If it brings about more jobs for Mexicans, Chinese, Indians, Negroes, groovy. It could be good, it could be bad. I couldn’t care less.” Her nonchalant attitude towards not only civil rights but any real-life issue is part of the reason that she has been forgotten as one of the “firsts” in black history.
              </p>

              <p> Absentmindedly, though, Luna was a pioneer for non-white models in the fashion industry. Her work created a greater demand for a different aesthetic, which would prove important for future supermod- els like Naomi Campbell and Joan Smalls.
              </p>

              <p> Donyale Luna died in 1979 at the age of 33 of a heroine overdose in Rome, leaving behind an 18-month old daughter, Dream. Many mourn her early death, blaming it as the reason for fashion’s infrequent re- membrance of her. And yet many reacted to the news of her death with nostalgic calm. Perhaps the unearthly creature wasn’t meant to live an ordinary life. Perhaps her beauty was meant to be only an ephemeral dream.
