        <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>

<a> My name is Maria Luisa Peralta. I was born and raised in San Jose, Costa Rica. I was always the ~creative kid~ in a family full of only lawyers and politicians, so coming here took a lot of convincing. I want to learn to code like a badass so that I can fully understand something that the rest of my family never will. Having never coded before, in creative computing I loved using CSS and images to make compositions but I would like to learn to make a page that looks finished and considered in every aspect. </a>
