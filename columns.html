            point, Vogue started not only reporting on fashion as they always had, but creating it.
            This was problematic because part of the fashion industry is creating a market that consumers can
            buy. How can you buy a patternless dress that could be anything? Nonetheless, this became a great
            moment in fashion and one that this spread pays homage to. Nonetheless, this became a great moment
